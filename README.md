Gosqueeze - Squeeze Box Controller
==================================

Getting the squeeze box setup
-----------------------------
From wiki.slimdevices.com/index.php/SBRFrontButtonAndLED.

To go to setup mode:
1. Press and hold the button for about 3 seconds or until it blinks slow *red* then release it.
2. The LED will go red solid, which means it is booting up. This will take a couple of seconds.
3. The LED will start slowly blinking red, which means it is in setup mode.
